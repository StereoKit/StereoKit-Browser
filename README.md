# StereoKit Browser

This is a short [StereoKit](https://stereokit.net) sample that shows implementing a browser UI widget using [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp)!

_You can see this in motion [over here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/koujaku/status/1513750989894930433) :)_

This is primarily for Windows Desktop XR, and does **NOT** support mobile or Linux. In the future, I'd love to extend this code with some additional platform support! Or if you have the opportunity for it, this would make an awesome contribution to the StereoKit community :)
